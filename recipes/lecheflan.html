        <h2>How to Cook Leche Flan</h2>
        <p>Making your own leche flan can be easy if you follow the recipe below and watch the cooking video. Start by beating the egg yolks in a mixing bowl. You can do it the manual way using a fork or use a hand mixer or a stand mixer. Ensure that the eggs are smooth. Gradually add the milk. Start with the condensed milk followed by the fresh milk and vanilla extract. Continue to beat all the ingredients in the bowl until these are well blended. Set this aside for the meantime while you prepare for the next process.
            <br>
            Grab your llanera or baking pan and place some sugar on it. Heat it over a stove top while holding the pan. Wear oven gloves to protect your hands. You will need to heat it until the sugar melts and turns into caramel. Once the happens, spread the caramel evenly on the llanera or mold that you are using. Slowly add the mixture into each mold and then cover the mold with foil.
            <br>
            The last process is to steam the mold. Simply arrange all the mold in a steamer and steam for a good 30 minutes or so until the mixture turns into yummy flan. At this point, you will decide if you want to dig in right away, or let it cook down a bit. I usually try to control myself at this point and wait until it cools down. I then place the flan in the refrigerator for best results.

        <ol>
            <li>Using all the eggs, separate the yolk from the egg white (only egg yolks will be used).</li>
            <li>Place the egg yolks in a big bowl then beat them using a fork or an egg beater.</li>
            <li>Add the condensed milk and mix thoroughly</li>
            <li>Pour-in the fresh milk and Vanilla. Mix well</li>
            <li>Put the mold (llanera) on top of the stove and heat using low fire</li>
            <li>Put-in the granulated sugar on the mold and mix thoroughly until the solid sugar turns into liquid (caramel) having a light brown color. Note: Sometimes it is hard to find a Llanera (Traditional flan mold) depending on your location. I find it more convenient to use individual Round Pans in making leche flan.</li>
            <li>Spread the caramel (liquid sugar) evenly on the flat side of the mold</li>
            <li>Wait for 5 minutes then pour the egg yolk and milk mixture on the mold</li>
