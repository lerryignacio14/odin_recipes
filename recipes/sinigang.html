        <h2>How to Cook Sinigang</h2>
        <p>Pork Sinigang is delicious and easy to prepare. Note that this recipe will require to saute the onion and pork. Start by heating cooking oil in a cooking pot. Saute the onion until it gets soft. Add the sliced pork. We are using pork belly (or liempo) for this recipe. You may also use other pork slices such as shoulders or parts with bones. Add some fish sauce and continue to cook until the pork turns light brown.
            <br>
            It is time to add the liquid. This recipe calls for water. You may want to use half water and half beef broth if you prefer your sinigang to be really flavorful. Let the liquid boil and then add the tomato and taro (gabi). The tomato needs to blend in with the broth while the taro will need to cook for a longer time so that it will start to release starch that will make the soup thicker.
            <br>
            The souring agent for this recipe is a tamarind soup base mix, which is more popularly known as  sinigang mix. This is a quicker alternative to fresh tamarind and it will save you time. Add the mix once meat is tender. Add some long green chili, if desired. This will make your soup spicy good. Add the rest of the vegetables towards the last few minutes. Make sure to add the spinach last.
            This is best served with a condiment composed of fish sauce and lots of hot chili pepper.

        <h2>Tips in Cooking Sinigang</h2>
        <p>Make sure to cook the pork until very tender. I really mean it. You don't want to challenge yourself by chewing the meat with all your might while the nice hot broth slowly cools down. Otherwise, enjoy the broth first before working on the meat.
            <br>
            Onion and tomato brings-in flavor to the broth. Cook it during the initial steps. Some people like their tomato intact. If you are one of these people, I suggest to cook half of the tomato initially and add the remaining once the dish is almost done.
            <br>
            You can still make sinigang even without all the vegetable in the list. All you need is pork, green leafy veggies, and the souring agent. Of course, water is essential for this recipe.
            <br>
            Busy people can use a slow cooker to cook sinigang. Make sure to add the spinach or kangkong only when you are about to eat. It is best to have these fresh.

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This recipe can also be used for beef, chicken, and fish. </li>
            <li>Souring agents also include tamarind, bilimbi, unripe mango, and calamansi. I used “sinigang mix” for this recipe  for convenience. It also gives the exact amount of sourness that I like for my sinigang.</li>
            <li>Taro is nice to have. It will give your soup a thicker texture. However, you can still make this dish without it.</li>
            <li>Sliced daikon radish are used in some version. Feel free to add some if preferred.</li>
            <li>I used spinach for this recipe. A more traditional approach is the use of water spinach (kangkong). </li>
            <li>If spinach or water spinach are not available, you can use bok choy.</li>
        </ul>
