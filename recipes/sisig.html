        <h2>How to Cook Sisig</h2>
        <p>This sisig recipe starts by boiling pork belly and pig ears until tender. These are then grilled for a few minutes until it browns and develops a good texture. I chop the meat into small pieces after grilling.
            Start cooking the sisig by sautéing ginger. Add chicken liver. Cook it thoroughly. Note that ginger is an optional ingredient for this sisig version. I added it to reduce the gaminess of chicken liver. Feel free to use it based on your preference.
            Add the minced meat. These are the pork belly and ears. Make sure to blend all the ingredients together. This will balance the flavor of the dish. Add the seasonings and spices afterwards.
            You have the option to use a metal plate to serve the dish. This can also be served on a regular plate. I topped this version with egg. This is optional.
            Try this delicious Sisig Recipe and let me know what you think.</p>
